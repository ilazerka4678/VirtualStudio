    <h1><div> Here are some of the spots I know in NYC!</div></h1>
    <ul> <span>
        <li> My favorite place in all of NYC must be Hudson River Park! It has all kinds of parks, restaurants, and is just beautiful, although a little expensive. </li>
        <li> I also really like an area in Brooklyn called Manhattan Beach - it is really nice to walk through it, as it is quiet and clean. </li>
        <li> A place I don't like a whole lot is Brighton Beach - it's always loud because of the overhead train and is always covered in trash.</li>
        <li> A similar place to Brighton Beach is 86th Street and Bay Parkway. Even though that's where I first lived, I definitely don't have fond memories of that area!</li>
    </span></ul>
